                  [--no-verify] [<repository> [<refspec>...]][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.[m
[m
       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into it, by setting up [4mhooks[24m there. See[m
       documentation for [1mgit-receive-pack[0m(1).[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify where to push with the [1m<repository>[0m argument, [1mbranch.*.remote[0m configuration for the[m
       current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to [4morigin[24m.[m
[m
       When the command line does not specify what to push with [1m<refspec>...[0m arguments or [1m--all[0m, [1m--mirror[0m, [1m--tags[0m options, the[m
       command finds the default [1m<refspec>[0m by consulting [1mremote.*.push[0m configuration, and if it is not found, honors [1mpush.default[0m[m
       configuration to decide what to push (See [1mgit-config[0m(1) for the meaning of [1mpush.default[0m).[m
[m
       When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what to push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds[m
       to the [1msimple[0m value for [1mpush.default[0m: the current branch is pushed to the corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety[m
       measure, the push is aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the local one.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       <repository>[m
           The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section[m
           GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).[m
[m
       <refspec>...[m
           Specify what destination ref to update with what source object. The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus[m
           [1m+[0m, followed by the source object <src>, followed by a colon [1m:[0m, followed by the destination ref <dst>.[m
[m
           The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such[m
           as [1mmaster~4[0m or [1mHEAD[0m (see [1mgitrevisions[0m(7)).[m
[m
           The <dst> tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an[m
           actual ref must be named. If [1mgit[0m [1mpush[0m [1m[<repository>][0m without any [1m<refspec>[0m argument is set to update some ref at the[m
           destination with [1m<src>[0m with [1mremote.<repository>.push[0m configuration variable, [1m:<dst>[0m part can be omitted—such a push[m
           will update a ref that [1m<src>[0m normally updates without any [1m<refspec>[0m on the command line. Otherwise, missing [1m:<dst>[0m[m
           means to update the same ref as the [1m<src>[0m.[m
[m
           The object referenced by <src> is used to update the <dst> reference on the remote side. By default this is only[m
           allowed if <dst> is not a tag (annotated or lightweight), and then only if it can fast-forward <dst>. By having the[m
           optional leading [1m+[0m, you can tell Git to update the <dst> ref even if it is not allowed by default (e.g., it is not a[m
           fast-forward.) This does [1mnot[0m attempt to merge <src> into <dst>. See EXAMPLES below for details.[m
[m
           [1mtag[0m [1m<tag>[0m means the same as [1mrefs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>[0m.[m
[m
           Pushing an empty <src> allows you to delete the <dst> ref from the remote repository.[m
[m
           The special refspec [1m:[0m (or [1m+:[0m to allow non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push "matching" branches: for every[m
           branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of the same name already exists on the[m
           remote side.[m
[m
       --all[m
           Push all branches (i.e. refs under [1mrefs/heads/[0m); cannot be used with other <refspec>.[m
[m
       --prune[m
           Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart. For example a remote branch [1mtmp[0m will be removed if a local[m
           branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g.  [1mgit[0m [1mpush[0m [1m--prune[0m [1mremote[0m[m
           [1mrefs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*[0m would make sure that remote [1mrefs/tmp/foo[0m will be removed if [1mrefs/heads/foo[0m doesn’t exist.[m
[m
       --mirror[m
           Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under [1mrefs/[0m (which includes but is not limited to[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the[m
       next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used[m
       to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in[m
       the working tree anymore.[m
[m
       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of[m
       the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the[m
       [1madd[0m command to add any new or modified files to the index.[m
[m
       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time[m
       the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run [1mgit[0m [1madd[0m again to add[m
       the new content to the index.[m
[m
       The [1mgit[0m [1mstatus[0m command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged for the next commit.[m
[m
       The [1mgit[0m [1madd[0m command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were explicitly specified on the command[m
       line, [1mgit[0m [1madd[0m will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by directory recursion or filename globbing[m
       performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The [4mgit[24m [4madd[24m command can be used to add[m
       ignored files with the [1m-f[0m (force) option.[m
[m
       Please see [1mgit-commit[0m(1) for alternative ways to add content to a commit.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       <pathspec>...[m
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  [1m*.c[0m) can be given to add all matching files. Also a leading directory name[m
           (e.g.  [1mdir[0m to add [1mdir/file1[0m and [1mdir/file2[0m) can be given to update the index to match the current state of the directory[m
           as a whole (e.g. specifying [1mdir[0m will record not just a file [1mdir/file1[0m modified in the working tree, a file [1mdir/file2[0m[m
           added to the working tree, but also a file [1mdir/file3[0m removed from the working tree. Note that older versions of Git[m
           used to ignore removed files; use [1m--no-all[0m option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.[m
[m
           For more details about the <pathspec> syntax, see the [4mpathspec[24m entry in [1mgitglossary[0m(7).[m
[m
       -n, --dry-run[m
           Don’t actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.[m
[m
       -v, --verbose[m
           Be verbose.[m
[m
       -f, --force[m
           Allow adding otherwise ignored files.[m
[m
       -i, --interactive[m
           Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to the index. Optional path arguments may be supplied to limit[m
           operation to a subset of the working tree. See “Interactive mode” for details.[m
[m
       -p, --patch[m
           Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user[m
           a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.[m
[m
           This effectively runs [1madd[0m [1m--interactive[0m, but bypasses the initial command menu and directly jumps to the [1mpatch[0m[m
           subcommand. See “Interactive mode” for details.[m
[m
       -e, --edit[m
           Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers[m
           and apply the patch to the index.[m
[m
           The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to[m
           be staged. This can be quicker and more flexible than using the interactive hunk selector. However, it is easy to[m
           confuse oneself and create a patch that does not apply to the index. See EDITING PATCHES below.[m
